This shows the OCEAN functionality for two-photon absorption (TPA). 

This example should reproduce the OCEAN-specific part of :
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.10785
Any results using this new functionality should cite that paper 
(or, if it exists, the resulting peer-reviewed journal article)


The photon files are:
1. Standard dipole
2. Standard quadrupole
3. Two-photon absorption, both photons have same polarization
4. The "quad"-like part of two-photon absorptioon
5. Only the part of the TPA with a 2p intermediate hole
6. Only the part of the TPA with a 3p intermediate hole
7. Only the part of the TPA with either a 2p or 3p intermediate hole
