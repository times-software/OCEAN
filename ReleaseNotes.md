## v. 3.2.0

#### Minor features
 1. Updates to the screening defaults. Should still be fast, but closer 
    to convergence
 2. Broadening approximation for XAS is no longer the default (column 2) in 
    outputs. The unbroadened spectrum (column 3) was already recommmended. 
 3. Updates to the Pseudo-Dojo potentials to add in f channels to the 
    following elements: Ba, Bi, I, Pb, Po, Rb, Rn, S, Te, Tl, and Xe. This is 
    in line with the v0.5 updates. They've been applied to LDA and PBEsol as
    well as PBE.
  
## v. 3.1.3

#### Bug fixes
 1. Crashing bug in RIXS of 2p when the underlying DFT calc had spin=1
 2. Fixed for ABINIT compatibility
 3. Small fixes for GW corrections

## v. 3.1.2

#### Minor features
 1. Reduction in the memory required for screening calculations. Could be a 
    substantial improvement for large systems.

#### Bug fixes
 1. Small, odd number k-point grids might have had slightly incorrect x-ray 
    spectra due to an error in how the k-point sampling was unfolded into a 
    supercell.
 2. Gamma-point selection for screening calculations was not being triggered.

## v. 3.1.0

#### Bug fixes
 1. The core-level shift was including the effect of V_{xc}. For self-energy 
    corrections, V_{xc} should be removed. Initial testing has shown that the 
    relative shifts between sites w/ or w/o V_{xc} are largely the same, but
    in absolute terms there will be a large change (10s of eVs).

## v. 3.0.4

#### Minor features
 1. The valence BSE can now self-consistently determine the static dielectric 
    constant by setting bse.val.epsilon_threshold to be > 0. 
 2. When using QuantumESPRESSO, the static dielctric constant of insulating 
    systems can be determined using density-functional perturbation theory. 
    This is attempted automatically if there is no dielectric constant set in 
    the input file. Systems run as metals will use a default value. 

#### Bug fixes
 1. Improved compatibility with older versions of QE. 
 2. Problems in the valence BSE with spin systems for both valence and RIXS.

## v. 3.0.3

#### Bug fixes
 1. A small, odd number for the first k-point dimension combined with a 
    different number of x-points in the first two dimensions could lead to 
    problems. 
 2. Some x-mesh grids could lead to failures in processing the density for
    valence calculations

## v. 3.0.2

#### Minor features
 1. MPSE support added back. The many-pole self-energy model from AI2NBSE has 
    been re-enabled. The scripts and source are in POST/MPSE. This is a post-
    processing step for after valence UV/optical calculations. 

#### Bug fixes
 1. Screening had small bug. Mostly didn't seem to change spectra, but 
    induced potential could change slightly from run to run. 

## v. 3.0.1

#### Major Features
 1. Completely new formatting for input files (the old format or a mix of old 
    and new are supported). The new style maps to a json file. See the file 
    Common/postDefaultsOceanDatafile for a complete picture of the input 
    following parsing the user-supplied inputs and filling in with defaults.

#### Bug fixes
 1. The Umklapp wasn't functioning correctly for large-q valence calculations
    (thanks Ishiaka Mansaray for the bug report).
 2. Potential problem in parsing the 'nelec' element in the QE xml output 
    (thanks Max Radin for the bug report).

## v. 2.9.7

### This is the pre-release/test run for 3.0

#### Major Features
 1. Support for D. R. Hamann's Optimized Norm-conserving Vanderbilt pseudopotentials
    1. Create your own
    2. Use built in database from PseudoDoJo collection
 2. Improvements to parallelism
    1. Screening calculation is faster
    2. Prep stage is faster too
 3. The DFT calculations for the BSE are split in two whenever there is finite-q

#### Minor Features
 1. OPF calculation should be slightly more robust, but noticeable differences are unlikely
 2. Large finite-q valence calculations should be working again

## v. 2.5.2

#### Major Features
 1. Impoved screening calculations
    1. Augmentation of pseudo-wavefunctions to restore all-electron character
    2. Much faster
 2. Better core-level shift calculations

## v. 2.1.1

#### Bugfixes

 2. Cleaned up inputs and defaults

#### Minor Features
 1. Improvements for spin with QE
 2. Database of core hole lifetime widths
 3. Changes to alignment! By default, OCEAN sets the DFT LUMO = 0. However! 
    When core_offset is specified the DFT energies will **not** be adjusted. 

#### Bugfixes
 1. Fixed bug in calculating the core-hole screening for some metals

## v. 2.0.4

#### Minor Features
 1. Improvements to OPF generation and error checking
 2. Consistency between ABINIT and QuantumESPRESSO occupation numbers (occopt/smearing/etc)

 1. Fixed major bug in the valence BSE regarding FFTs. 

## v. 2.0

#### Major Features:
1. RIXS! The valence BSE code (formerly AI2NBSE by Hadley Lawler, et al) is now included, allowing for direct RIXS calculations with a relatively simple workflow. See the diamond example. 
2. The optimal basis functions (PAW-style reconstruction) has been improved. Thanks to Eric Shirley for these changes.

#### Minor Features:
 1. Changes under the hood to MPI calls in the BSE.
 2. More consistent determination of the Fermi level for metallic systems.
 3. Better switching between (optional) FFTW3 and legacy FFT

#### Bug fixes

## v. 1.2.1

#### Minor Feature: Averaging spectra
At the end of the CNBSE section the code will automatically create averages: 
 1. By site over all photon files, e.g. for multiple polarizations
 2. By photon file over all sites
 3. Everything for the given edge

## v. 1.2.0

#### Major Feature: LDA+U
Fixed up LDA+U support (QuantumEspresso only). Thanks to Yufeng Liang for 
spearheading this effort.

Changed mpi_double to mpi_double_precision in several files. 
Thanks to Liang Li at ANL for the bug report.

## v. 1.1.4

#### Bug Fix
The array ordering of calls to FFTW was switched (C/Fort). Only compilations using 
FFTW (-D__FFTW3 in Makefile.arch) would have been affected.

## v. 1.1.3

#### Minor feature updates:
 1. Option to disable spin-orbit splitting from the input file
 2. Code can generate its own cnbse.spect_range

 2. Some support for FFTW instead of legacy FFT in OBF pathway
 3. Some support for RIXS workflows
